<h2 class="about-title">Get to know me, as an artist and as a person</h2>
<div class="about-boxes">
<div class="box">Early stages of my career:
At 13, I started developing a stronger interest in the creative arts. I attended various courses, such as animation, digital art, and other workshops. After I finished my secondary education,
I pursued a diploma in digital design at the MCAST Institute for the Creative Arts. It was here where I discovered my love-hate relationship with coding, photography, and other digital units.
By far my favorite of all is 3D modelling, which im currently pursuing.</div>
<div class="box">As a person:
As a person, I'd say im a very laid back person, however this is a double-edged blade as I often hold back on deadlines, ultimately still delivering excellent work, but limiting myself. I enjoy
spending time with my friends and staying awake for hours wondering what it all means.</div>
